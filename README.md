# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This Repo contains:
- ##  an R script called run_analysis.R 
that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- ## a Code Book called CodeBook.md:
that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data to produce a tidy dataset.

- ## a .txt file called TidyData.txt
that contains the output of the data cleaning excercise carried out.
